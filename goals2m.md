For the next two months our goals are to set up an example system
for demonstrating building automation scenarios. This will be based
on a very personal use case: Helsinki Hacklab is in desperate need
for easily extendable and open (standards wise) building automation.

This is necessary for demonstrations in general and also work in
the POINT H2020 research project. It will also act as a kind of basis
for service design work to identify future opportunities for running
building services and possibly new kinds of business models such as
Light as a Service, Heating as a service and so on.

On hardware side, we are currently in the process of running a small
production series of RasPoE, a Raspberry Pi PoE splitter board. Selling
our previous boards on Ebay is starting during August 2015 with RasPoE
joining ranks whenever we have the produce run available.

On non-technical side, we need business development as our platform
is approaching beta-level and we are searching for designs based on
our work. We have started an effort Daily Greens for that purpose and
Jukka Korpihete is wanting to use our platform for lighting products.
As our business model is somewhat complex, the actual money flow is
mostly related to these vertical business opportunities that then
either do work on the platform itself or sponsor the platform development
to suit their purposes better. This will benefit all.
