For the next two months our goals are to set up an example system
for demonstrating building automation scenarios. This will be based
on a very personal use case: Helsinki Hacklab is in desperate need
for easily extendable and open (standards wise) building automation.

This is necessary for demonstrations in general and also work in
the POINT H2020 research project. It will also act as a kind of basis
for service design work to identify future opportunities for running
building services and possibly new kinds of business models such as
Light as a Service, Heating as a service and so on.
