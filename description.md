ELL-i is an open source technology platform to enable building secure
constrained devices that communicate over public internet and the
necessary infrastructure to support a large number of devices from
varying number of vendors.

We enable building products based on open source technology,
much like Linux kernel and SSH protocol.

Our business model is modeled after the foundation-corporate pattern
modified to suit Finnish legislation.
